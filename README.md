# ParkingApp

ParkingApp(working title) is a web application designed to solve the complex problem of parking and urban congestion. ParkingApp is a crowd sourced solution to parking in metropolitan areas, initially designed for a target market at the University in Tucson, Arizona. By allowing users to rent out their private parking spots we hope to solve the problem of underutilized parking infrastructure, while simultaneously generating passive income for users. Ideal for those who are visiting downtown areas, universities, sporting events, or may even be looking for a long term parking solution, ParkingApp is here to serve your needs!

## Getting Started

In order to get this program running on a local system for development or testing, you will need to follow several steps. If you would like to view an already working model, the application is hosted at 

* Clone the repository and run the schema.sql file located in the 'db' folder. This will set up the initial database necessary for the SQL tables. You will need a SQL command line or program to do this such as SQLPro or MySQL.
* Make sure to change the 'config.json' inside the 'config' folder to the information corresponding to your local SQL database.
* Execute the 'npm install' command when inside the cloned repository in order to install the necessary node packages.
* Run the server.js file to allow the sequelize ORM to setup the tables and their relations.
* Inside the 'db' folder is a seeds.sql file, use this file and your preferred method to seed the SQL database.

### Prerequisites


```
SQL
```
You will need a SQL program such as MySQL or SQLPro in order to create the database and view/seed the data within.
